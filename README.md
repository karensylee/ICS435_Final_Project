**My ICS435 project is predicting AIDS Using Machine Learning in HIV Clinical Trials.**

- The dataset consists of healthcare statistics collected from patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), initially published in 1996 by Hammer et al. see AIDS_Classification.csv in the data folder.

- The ICS435_FProject.pdf is the written submission.

- Three types of models were trained through Google Colab: Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The code for each model are the jupyter notebooks:
  - ICS435_FProject_NN.ipynb ;
  - ICS435_FProject_RF.ipynb ;
  - ICS435_FProject_SVM.ipynb

- The best trained models are saved in the models folder.
